# My Sinatra Project
## The start of a survey systemm.

### For the Flatiron School

#### Introduction

This Sinatra app was created as part of the requirements of the [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/)'s requirements in the Full Stack Developer program.  My goal was to learn how to use Sinatra to create a basic CRUD app.

To that end, my app is designed to offer the basics of a simply survey system.  At the moment, it only allows a user to register, log in, create a five question survey, edit a survey or delete a survey.  To flesh the project out, I would need to add a lot of CSS and JavaScript to improte the UI, add support for arbitrary sized surveys, and add the capability to take another user's survery and view the results of your surveys after other's have taken them.

#### Get started

This is a Sinatra app, so you need Ruby installed on your machine.  Then you can download this app, move into the directory where you put it, and do:

    bundle install

After that, do:

    shotgun

And that should launch a server for you.  Then, visit the designated address.  First you will need to register a user.  Then you can create surveys, edit them and delete them.  That's about it!
